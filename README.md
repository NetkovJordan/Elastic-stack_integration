## Introduction
Elastic Stack is a suite of open-source tools comprising Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, designed for real-time data ingestion, storage, analysis, and visualization. 
1. Elasticsearch acts as a distributed search and analytics engine, handling data storage and indexing.
2. Logstash serves as a data processing pipeline, facilitating the parsing, transformation, and enrichment of data before it's indexed in Elasticsearch.
3. Kibana offers a web-based interface for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing data stored in Elasticsearch.
While Beats, lightweight data shippers, are commonly used for data collection, for this example, we'll exclude their utilization, focusing solely on the core components of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elastic Stack is widely employed for tasks like log management, monitoring, metrics analysis, search, and data analysis, providing organizations with a comprehensive solution to manage and derive insights from their data efficiently.

## Explained architecture
We have a simple Node.js application that is exposed to port 3000. It automatically prints additional logs info/warning/error. This is for testing and better visualization.
The log file is extracted to an output.log file in the same directory as the app directory. We have logstash that is configured to read the log file generated by the Node.js app.
We have two configuration files that are meant for logstash:
- logstash.yml which specifies a wildcard address, meaning any IPv4 address associated with the machine network. And the second part is the path towards the config directory of the logstash.
- pipeline which contains the logstash.conf file. This file sets the path towards the output.log, starts from beggining and does not remember where it left of at restart since it is only for a test and not for a failsafe.
  We filter with grok, by timestamp, log level and the message. Lastly we output it to Elasticsearch which will create one index containing the logstash log since it is basic data.

Now Elasticsearch creates the index. To better view the data, we will need to add elasticvue in the browser as an extension. 
Lastly, logstash sends the indexed data to Kibana in which we can create visualizations of our data and better monitor our app logs.
